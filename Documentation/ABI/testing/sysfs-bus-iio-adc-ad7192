What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/ac_excitation_en
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Reading gives the state of AC excitation.
		Writing '1' enables AC excitation.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/bridge_switch_en
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This bridge switch is used to disconnect it when there is a
		need to minimize the system current consumption.
		Reading gives the state of the bridge switch.
		Writing '1' enables the bridge switch.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_voltagex_sys_calibration
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Initiates the system calibration procedure. This is done on a
		single channel at a time. Write '1' to start the calibration.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_voltagex_sys_calibration_mode_available
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Reading returns a list with the possible calibration modes.
		There are two available options:
		"zero_scale" - calibrate to zero scale
		"full_scale" - calibrate to full scale

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_voltagex_sys_calibration_mode
KernelVersion:
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Sets up the calibration mode used in the system calibration
		procedure. Reading returns the current calibration mode.
		Writing sets the system calibration mode.

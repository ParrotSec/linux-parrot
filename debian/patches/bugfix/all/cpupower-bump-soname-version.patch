Subject: cpupower: Bump soname version
Forwarded: http://mid.gmane.org/20160610005619.GQ7555@decadent.org.uk

Several functions in the libcpupower API are renamed or removed in
Linux 4.7.  This is an backward-incompatible ABI change, so the
library soname should change from libcpupower.so.0 to
libcpupower.so.1.

Fixes: ac5a181d065d ("cpupower: Add cpuidle parts into library")

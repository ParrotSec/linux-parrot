Subject: module: Avoid ABI changes when debug info is disabled
Forwarded: not-needed

CI builds are done with debug info disabled, but this removes some
members from struct module.  This causes builds to fail if there is an
ABI reference for the current ABI.

Define these members unconditionally, so that there is no ABI change.

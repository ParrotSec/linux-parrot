Subject: [PATCH 4/7] MODSIGN: Import certificates from UEFI Secure Boot
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jforbes/linux.git/commit/?id=7b7aae2efea13b5a7b80305856c28f235ea8b2fa

Secure Boot stores a list of allowed certificates in the 'db' variable.
This imports those certificates into the system trusted keyring.  This
allows for a third party signing certificate to be used in conjunction
with signed modules.  By importing the public certificate into the 'db'
variable, a user can allow a module signed with that certificate to
load.  The shim UEFI bootloader has a similar certificate list stored
in the 'MokListRT' variable.  We import those as well.

Secure Boot also maintains a list of disallowed certificates in the 'dbx'
variable.  We load those certificates into the newly introduced system
blacklist keyring and forbid any module signed with those from loading and
forbid the use within the kernel of any key with a matching hash.

This facility is enabled by setting CONFIG_LOAD_UEFI_KEYS.

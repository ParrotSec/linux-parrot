Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: disable USB type-c DisplayPort

The cdn-dp sub driver probes the device failed on PINEBOOK Pro.

kernel: cdn-dp fec00000.dp: [drm:cdn_dp_probe [rockchipdrm]] *ERROR* missing extcon or phy
kernel: cdn-dp: probe of fec00000.dp failed with error -22

Then, the device halts all of the DRM related device jobs. For example,
the operations: vop_component_ops, vop_component_ops and
rockchip_dp_component_ops cannot be bound to corresponding devices. So,
Xorg cannot find the correct DRM device.

The USB type-C DisplayPort does not work for now. So, disable the
DisplayPort node until the type-C phy work has been done.

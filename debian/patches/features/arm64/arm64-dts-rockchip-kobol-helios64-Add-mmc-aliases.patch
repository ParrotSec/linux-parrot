Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: kobol-helios64: Add mmc aliases

This patch is part of commit 5dcbe7e3862d ("arm64: dts: rockchip: move mmc
aliases to board dts on rk3399") upstream. It is applied here only for Kobol's
helios64 to simplify conflict resolution for some further patches. It currently
is a noop as the same aliases already exist in rk3399.dtsi.

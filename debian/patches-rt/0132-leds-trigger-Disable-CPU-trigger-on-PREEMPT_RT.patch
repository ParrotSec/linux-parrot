Subject: [PATCH 132/158] leds: trigger: Disable CPU trigger on PREEMPT_RT
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.15/older/patches-5.15.10-rt24.tar.xz

The CPU trigger is invoked on ARM from CPU-idle. That trigger later
invokes led_trigger_event() which may invoke the callback of the actual driver.
That driver can acquire a spinlock_t which is okay on kernel without
PREEMPT_RT. On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernel this lock is turned into a sleeping
lock and must not be acquired with disabled interrupts.

Disable the CPU trigger on PREEMPT_RT.

Subject: [PATCH 295/296] net: xfrm: Use sequence counter with associated
 spinlock
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.10/older/patches-5.10.35-rt39.tar.xz

A sequence counter write section must be serialized or its internal
state can get corrupted. A plain seqcount_t does not contain the
information of which lock must be held to guaranteee write side
serialization.

For xfrm_state_hash_generation, use seqcount_spinlock_t instead of plain
seqcount_t.  This allows to associate the spinlock used for write
serialization with the sequence counter. It thus enables lockdep to
verify that the write serialization lock is indeed held before entering
the sequence counter write section.

If lockdep is disabled, this lock association is compiled out and has
neither storage size nor runtime overhead.

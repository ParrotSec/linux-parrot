Subject: sched: Limit the number of task migrations per batch on RT
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2021 14:24:25 +0200
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.15/older/patches-5.15.3-rt21.tar.xz

Batched task migrations are a source for large latencies as they keep the
scheduler from running while processing the migrations.

Limit the batch size to 8 instead of 32 when running on a RT enabled
kernel.

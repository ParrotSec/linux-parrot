Subject: x86: stackprotector: Avoid random pool on rt
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.6/older/patches-5.6.10-rt5.tar.xz

CPU bringup calls into the random pool to initialize the stack
canary. During boot that works nicely even on RT as the might sleep
checks are disabled. During CPU hotplug the might sleep checks
trigger. Making the locks in random raw is a major PITA, so avoid the
call on RT is the only sensible solution. This is basically the same
randomness which we get during boot where the random pool has no
entropy and we rely on the TSC randomnness.

Subject: [PATCH 021/158] efi: Disable runtime services on RT
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.15/older/patches-5.15.10-rt24.tar.xz

Based on measurements the EFI functions get_variable /
get_next_variable take up to 2us which looks okay.
The functions get_time, set_time take around 10ms. These 10ms are too
much. Even one ms would be too much.
Ard mentioned that SetVariable might even trigger larger latencies if
the firmware will erase flash blocks on NOR.

The time-functions are used by efi-rtc and can be triggered during
run-time (either via explicit read/write or ntp sync).

The variable write could be used by pstore.
These functions can be disabled without much of a loss. The poweroff /
reboot hooks may be provided by PSCI.

Disable EFI's runtime wrappers on PREEMPT_RT.

This was observed on "EFI v2.60 by SoftIron Overdrive 1000".

Subject: [PATCH] printk: print "rate-limitted" message as info
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.6/older/patches-5.6.10-rt5.tar.xz

If messages which are injected via kmsg are dropped then they don't need
to be printed as warnings. This is to avoid latency spikes if the
interface decides to print a lot of important messages.

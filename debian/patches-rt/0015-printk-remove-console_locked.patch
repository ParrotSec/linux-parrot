Subject: [PATCH 15/18] printk: remove @console_locked
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.18/older/patches-5.18-rt10.tar.xz

The static global variable @console_locked is used to help debug
VT code to make sure that certain code paths are running with
the console_lock held. However, this information is also available
with the static global variable @console_kthreads_blocked (for
locking via console_lock()), and the static global variable
@console_kthreads_active (for locking via console_trylock()).

Remove @console_locked and update is_console_locked() to use the
alternative variables.

Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: skip DRM_I915_LOW_LEVEL_TRACEPOINTS with NOTRACE
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.6/older/patches-5.6.10-rt5.tar.xz

The order of the header files is important. If this header file is
included after tracepoint.h was included then the NOTRACE here becomes a
nop. Currently this happens for two .c files which use the tracepoitns
behind DRM_I915_LOW_LEVEL_TRACEPOINTS.

	  This driver supports network switches from the Vitesse /
	  Microsemi / Microchip Ocelot family of switching cores that are
	  connected to their host CPU via Ethernet.
	  The following switches are supported:
	  - VSC9959 (Felix): embedded as a PCIe function of the NXP LS1028A
	    ENETC integrated endpoint.
	  - VSC9953 (Seville): embedded as a platform device on the
	    NXP T1040 SoC.

* Don't use v4l2_async_notifier_parse_fwnode_endpoints_by_port().
e.g. isp_parse_of_endpoints in drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/isp.c
cio2_parse_firmware in drivers/media/pci/intel/ipu3/ipu3-cio2.c.
* Fix pad format size for statistics and parameters entities.
* Use threaded interrupt for rkisp1_stats_isr(), remove work queue.
* Fix checkpatch errors.
* Make sure uapi structs have the same size and layout in 32 and 62 bits,
and that there are no holes in the structures (pahole is a utility that
can be used to test this).
* Review and comment every lock
* Handle quantization
* Document rkisp1-common.h
* streaming paths (mainpath and selfpath) check if the other path is streaming
in several places of the code, review this, specially that it doesn't seem it
supports streaming from both paths at the same time.

NOTES:
* All v4l2-compliance test must pass.
* Stats and params can be tested with libcamera and ChromiumOS stack.
